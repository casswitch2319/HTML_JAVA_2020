                    My name is Cassandre Federowicz, or Cass. I am 27 years old. It's been about 6-7 years since I have been in school. Video games have always been my favorite hobby. I do enjoy TV and Movies but video games have always been my favorite. I currently Dispatch for <a href="https://www.northeast.aaa.com/">AAA</a> on the overnight shift. I've been with AAA for five years and it finally allowed for me to have enough free time and control over my shifts to do both. I used  to bartend and kind of miss it.I also have a twitch channel and have a small following. I've been an affilliate for about 6 months. I don't make too much from it but I do it mostly for fun. One thing people eventually figure out about me is that I am constantly dying my hair. It should have fallen out by now if I didnt spend a bunch of money on good hair products. Besides that I am a pretty low key person.
