                <p id="p1">My name is Cassandre Federowicz, or Cass. I am 27 years old. It's been about 6-7 years since I have been in school. Video games have always been my favorite hobby. I do enjoy TV and Movies but video games have always been my favorite. I currently Dispatch for AAA on the overnight shift. I've been with AAA for five years and it finally allowed for me to have enough free time and control over my shifts to do both. I used  to bartend and kind of miss it.I also have a twitch channel and have a small following. I've been an affilliate for about 6 months. I don't make too much from it but I do it mostly for fun. One thing people eventually figure out about me is that I am constantly dying my hair. It should have fallen out by now if I didnt spend a bunch of money on good hair products. Besides that I am a pretty low key person.</p>
